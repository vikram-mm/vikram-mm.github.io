1) To run 

	Click on index.html

	This is a static page and hence the credential validation has been removed. 

	Navigating to student home page - Click on student login and submit button (no credentials required)
	Navigating to faculty home page - Click on faculty login and submit button (no credentials required)

	Provision for the "invalid credentials!" alert has been made in the code, and can be used suitably by the back-end.

	index.html   - home page of E-learning portal.
